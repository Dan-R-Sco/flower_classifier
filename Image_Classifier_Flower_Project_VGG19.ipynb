For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. \n","\n","In this project, an image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. The following dataset will be used: [dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below. \n","\n","<img src='assets/Flowers.png' width=500px>\n","\n","The project is broken down into multiple steps:\n","\n","* Load and preprocess the image dataset\n","* Train the image classifier on your dataset\n","* Use the trained classifier to predict image content\n","\n","\n","When the project is completed, we'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here the network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what what can be done with this CNN is limitted by your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it.\n","\n","First up is importing the packages you'll need. It's good practice to keep all the imports at the beginning of your code. As you work through this notebook and find you need to import a package, make sure to add the import up here.\n","\n","The program is run on Colab. So, we need to install torch first before running code.

Inference for classification\n","\n","Now we'll write a function to use a trained network for inference. An image will be passes into the network and predict the class of the flower in the image. We will write a function called `predict` that takes an image and a model, then returns the top $K$ most likely classes along with the probabilities. \n","\n","First let's processing the input image such that it can be used in the network. \n","\n","## Image Preprocessing\n","\n","We'll use `PIL` to load the image and  write a function that preprocesses the image so it can be used as input for the model. This function should process the images in the same manner used for training. \n","\n","The following steps need to be done: \n","First, resize the images where the shortest side is 256 pixels, keeping the aspect ratio. Then we'll need to crop out the center 224x224 portion of the image.\n","\n","Color channels of images are typically encoded as integers 0-255, but the model expected floats 0-1. We'll need to convert the values. It's easiest with a Numpy array, which you can get from a PIL image like so `np_image = np.array(pil_image)`.\n","\n","As before, the network expects the images to be normalized in a specific way. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`. We  want to subtract the means from each color channel, then divide by the standard deviation. \n","\n","And finally, PyTorch expects the color channel to be the first dimension but it's the third dimension in the PIL image and Numpy array. WE can reorder dimensions using [`ndarray.transpose`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.transpose.html). The color channel needs to be first and retain the order of the other two dimensions.\n"]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"KSzF09SHWJ1M"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Class Prediction\n","\n","Once we can get images in the correct format, it's time to write a function for making predictions with our model.
