### Introduction

This image classifier can distinguish different species of flowers from 102 categories[this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). It uses trained Convolutional Neural Networks provided in PyTorch, which is a freely available Deep Learning module kindly offered by Facebook.

### Code 

Code was developed in the provided template in Jupyter Notebook. It is well commented and can be found in this repo. Due to the huge number of parameters in the developed model and intensive matrix/tensor computations it is recommended to use gpu. The Colab was used for this purpose. 

### Version control 

I have tried to manage the version control based on thi
